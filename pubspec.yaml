  A lightweight and configurable shake animation widget for Flutter.
  Includes presets for error, warning, and subtle feedback.

  `flutter_shake_widget` provides a clean and extensible way to add **shake feedback**
  to widgets and text. It is commonly used for **form validation, error messages,
  warnings, and subtle UI hints**.

  The package is **framework-agnostic** and works with **GetX, Bloc, Riverpod,
  or plain Flutter** without introducing any external dependencies.
